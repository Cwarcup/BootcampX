Each query will be written in it's own `.sql` file.

Before starting a new exercise, create a new directory that all of the query files can be stored in.

Because each query will be inside its own file, we can write all of the `SQL` code in our text editor.

We will then execute the query against our database using `\i filename.sql` from within our `psql` session.
